# Decision Tree & Random Forest

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting potential customers using supervised machine learning models. The main objective is to maximize recall, ensuring that high-potential customers are not missed, while keeping the models interpretable for business decision-making.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral information used to predict whether a customer is likely to convert.

**Note:** The raw dataset is not included in this repository due to course usage restrictions.

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and scaling  
- Train-test split  
- Decision Tree classification  
- Random Forest classification  
- Model evaluation using recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- Feature importance analysis
